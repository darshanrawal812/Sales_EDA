# Sales_EDA

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Diwali sales data. The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into the sales patterns and trends during the Diwali festival season, which is known for high consumer spending.

The dataset used in this project contains information about Indian states, including customer gender, marital status of customer, amount, product categories and more. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to uncover valuable information about consumer behavior, popular product categories, regional preferences, and other factors that influence sales during Diwali.
